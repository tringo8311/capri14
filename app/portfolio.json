Using our own unique method, we pull a very strong “shot” of tea, creating something similar to an espresso, simply made with tea not coffee. We then pour over perfectly steamed milk to craft a drink that gives you an incredibly refreshing and velvety mouth filling feeling. Our blend of tea has been engineered to work alongside our flavours and milk, to produce that harmonious balance that you can enjoy right until the last sip. Unlike coffee, we don’t need to use tons of flavouring to overcompensate for competing characteristics in the same cup.For vegans, the super health-conscious, or simply as an alternative, we have sugar free flavourings and different milk options."
